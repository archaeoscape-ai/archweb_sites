- Docker container with Apache, PHP5.6, MySQL installed
- MySQL database is imported from mysql_dump_pkks.sql
- Docker container will bind mount and serve the html folder, allowing
  for a measure of live debugging/development
-   
  #+begin_src bash
  # Will build the Docker image
  bash 01_build_docker_image.sh
  # Will start the container in interactive mode and bind the html folder
  bash 02_start_docker_server.sh
  #+end_src

- After executing these scripts access the webserver at http://localhost:80
- 
  #+begin_src bash
